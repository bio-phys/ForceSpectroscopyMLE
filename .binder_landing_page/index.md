Click the link below to launch a JupyterLab environment in the Cloud and try the `pipeline_example.ipynb` notebook.  

You can either analyze the data sets found in `examples/mock_data/` or upload your own via the File Browser on the left-hand side.  The interactive session is only temporary and **files will be deleted after termination** (File -> Shut Down).  The (possibly modified) notebook, as well as data files and figures that are exported, can be downloaded via the File Browser.  

----

**Important:** Please shut down JupyterLab properly after use via the drop-down menu (File -> Shut Down) to free resources for other users.
